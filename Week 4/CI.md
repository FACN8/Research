## what is Continuous Integration?

Continuous integration is a DevOps (set of practices that combine Software Development and IT operations) software development practice is where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.

---

## Why is Continuous Integration Needed?

In the past, developers on a team might work in isolation for an extended period of time and only merge their changes to the master branch once their work was completed. 

- Difficult and Time Consuming
- Bugs accumulating without correction
- Harder to deliver updates to customers quickly 

---

## Key Goals of CI are:

1) Address bugs quicker
2) Improve Software Quality
3) Reduce time to validate and release new Software Updates

---

## How does Continuos Integration work?

With CI, developers frequently commit to a shared repository using a version control system such as Git. Prior to each commit, A CI service such as Circle CI automatically builds and runs unit tests on the new code changes to immediately surface any errors.
