## Advantages/disadvantages
### NoSQL Advantages

- More agile storage and processing 
- Large volumes of data
- quick iteration
- Object-oriented programming that is easy to use and flexible

---

### NoSQL disAdvantages

- Have less of functionalities.(not relational) Don’t support ACID.
- In order to support ACID developers will have to implement their own code, making their systems more complex.
- NoSQL is not compatible (at all) with SQL.(if you still have relational SQL DB you still need to create your own qureies to work with NoSQL )
- ###### ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) refers to a standard set of properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably.

---

### SQL Advantages
- SQL can be used in the program in PCs, servers, laptops, and even some of the mobile phones.
- Relational database.
- No coding needed
It is very easy to manage the database systems without any need to write the substantial amount of code by using the standard SQL.
- Multiple data views With the help of SQL language, the users can make different views of database structure and databases for the different users

---

### SQL disAdvantages

- The programmers who use SQL doesn’t have a full control over the database because of the hidden business rules.
- Since SQL has a complex structure, it becomes difficult for certain users to access it.
